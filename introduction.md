## Objective

This lesson is designed for absolute beginners in digital humanities research. Its goal is to help 
humanities scholars understand when, why, and how programming can be a valuable tool for data 
analysis in their work.

By the end of this lesson, you will have learned the basic principles of data analysis with a focus 
on quantitative research in the humanities using Python. You will be better equipped to determine 
whether incorporating programming and quantitative methods is meaningful for analyzing your 
research data. Youâ€™ll also be able to evaluate whether digitizing, processing, and publishing 
existing analog or material data could benefit your own research and contribute to the broader 
scholarly community.
